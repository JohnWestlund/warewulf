MICHOST:
Setup for MIC provisioning under Warewulf. 
85-michost sets the basic first stage of configurations for MIC cards support.
It mainly does two tasks:
    a) setup a bridge interface br0 and attach eth0 to it. Note that the 
    proper bridge support package must be available in the node image for br0 
    to work (brigde-utils). 
    b) Copies all the networking data setup in the master node to 
    99-michost.wwfb so the cards get configuring during the OS boot.

Use the wwfirstboot.conf MICPATH variable, to define  where to create the 
nodes MIC images. These images must be unique for each card in each node. 

Once nodes are booted and up the wwfirstboot script 99-michost.wwfb will 
attempt the following steps:

  1. Loading module mic.ko
  2. Initialize basic configurations micctrlt --initdefaults.
  3. Set each card filesystem to $MICPATH/mic[x]
  4. Set the networking information configured. 
  5. Set the NFS shares for the cards to mount.
  6. Start MPSS

Steps needed:
  1. Set the number of MIC cards on a Node 
    wwsh mic set --mic=2 node000
  2. Set the IP Addresses of the cards 
    wwsh node set --netdev=mic0 --ipaddr=192.168.1.3 --netmask=255.255.255.0 node000
    wwsh node set --netdev=mic1 --ipaddr=192.168.1.4 --netmask=255.255.255.0 node000
  3. Set kargs on nodes to load mic.ko module
    wwsh provision set --kargs="wwkmod=mic quiet" node000
  4. Fully rebuild bootstrap: 
    wwbootstrap `uname -r`
