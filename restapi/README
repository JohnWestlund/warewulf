Warewulf::Module::REST

Adam DeConinck @ R-HPC, 2011

A basic REST interface to the Warewulf provisioning system, based 
on Perl Dancer.  Carries out provisioning actions and returns 
data in JSON format.

To run in the standalone test server, cd into Warewulf-Module-REST and run 
    perl bin/app.pl

To run in a "real" webserver, see

Jason Stover @ R-HPC, 2014

Fixed for Warewulf > 3.1. All GET requests should work (2014-10-02).
