# General Vnfs configuration file.
#
# You can also create a VNFS specific configuration file in the vnfs/
# configuration directory named "vnfs/[name].conf". There you can put
# additional information and configuration paramaters.

# GZIP COMMAND
# What is the gzip command you wish to use to compress the VNFS. 
#
# note: the environment variable PATH is ignored, so if the command
# you wish to use is in a non-standard location, include the full path
# below.
#

gzip command = gzip -9



# EXCLUDE
# Excluding files will always remove them from the built VNFS.
#
# note: previous config versions used "excludes" which is now the same
# as "hybridize".

exclude += /var/log/*
exclude += /var/cache
exclude += /usr/src
exclude += /home/*



# HYBRIDIZE
# Hybridization will remove files from the VNFS and
# replace them with a symbolic link to hybridpath (if it exists). If
# hybridpath does not exist, those files will just be excluded.
