	This is designed to create vnfs frameworks for a wide range of distros and
	hardware. No matter which bash capable distro or hardware architecture the
	host machine may be.

	FEATURES:

		cross debootstrap:
			Automatically uses QEMU to build vnfs for non native architecture 
			ie. create a 32 bit vnfs on a 64 bit machine or other debian supported arch.
			note: Building a 64 bit vnfs on a 32 operating system is likely to fail.

		multiple .deb flavors:
			By default will allow the creation of any release of Debian or Ubuntu.
			Options exist to allow creation of most any version/architecture from
			most any distro/repository.

		warewulf import:
			Chose to allow ( wwbootstrap  and/or wwvnfs ) to automatically import the
			created vnfs into warewulf.

		After vnfs creation, it is easy to add additional packages in the chroot environment
		by using the included package manager for .deb based systems.

			wwmkchroot -h deb-pkgmanager



	TROUBLESHOOTING:

          Building a 64 bit vnfs on a 32 operating system is likely to fail. Theoretically, QEMU should
          allow the creation of 64 bit vnfs on a 32 bit OS. This may or may not be possible with 64 bit
          kernel installed, and a CPU that supports virtualization, which must also be turned on in BIOS.
          

          There are times when building a vnfs for a distro different from the host machine, the
          host system will fail to find the correct debootsrap build file. Many times the files
          in question only need be a link to some standard file. For instance, when trying to
          build an Ubuntu vnfs on a Debian host system, you may encounter an error as such :
			  No such script: /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/oneiric

          You may choose one of the following two options to solve this type of error.
          For instance, the script to debootstrap an Ubuntu oneiric system is the same script used for the
          Debian gutsy release. A system wide solution would be to create a correctly named symbolic link
          pointing to the required file. Such a solution would look like:

		     sudo ln -s -T /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/gutsy /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/oneiric

          When creating such a link is undesirable, another solution would be to add the following variable
          to the recipe file.

          QEMUFILENAME="/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/oneiric"


          Errors like the following are caused by a mismatch between distro and codename.
          This error was created by trying to use an Ubuntu codename with a Debian repository.
          Debian servers do not have Ubuntu repos.

		     Failed getting release file http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/oneiric/Release


	RECIPE'S:

		Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.

	Manditory Ingredients:
		These variable are the minimun required, and must be in all recipe files.

          DISTRO
          ARCH
          CODENAME
          

	Advanced Options:
          There are 2 ways to include values in recipe files. You can either
          add additional choices to the default list, or you can override
          the defaults using one of the following options.

	______________________________________________________________________
          This format will add additional values to the defaults.
          Only this variable support this format.

          COMPONENTS="${COMPONENTS},source1,source-2,source_3"

	______________________________________________________________________

          This format will override and replace the defaults, and only these values will
          be used. Usefull for when needing specific package versions such as kernel's
          or excluding files and/or directories from being imported into warewulf etc .. 
	______________________________________________________________________

          
          AUTO=1	-	The default behavior is to prompt the user to validate the steps taken
                        This option will not prompt and force the default action for all questions.
		
          NO_GPG=1	-	Skip signature validation for secure mirrors.

          MEMLOCK="8388608"

          VARIANT="minbase"

          QEMUFILENAME="qemu-arm-static"

          NEWHOSTNAME="Deb-Nodes"     -     Set a default host name for the nodes

          COMPONENTS="source1,source-2,source_3"    -    Change componets such as main contrib

          PKGLIST="package1 package-2 package_3"    -    Replace the default package list with these

          EXCLUDEPKG="package1 package-2 package_3" -    Debootstrap will exclude these packages from the install

          OS_MIRROR="http://packages.linuxmint.com" -    Set a custom mirror for deboostrap to get its packages from.

          EXCLUSIONS="/path_to/file /path_to/directory" - These are warewulf exclusions that will be omitted from the vnfs capsule


          Will auto mount iso's for inclusion in vnfs capsules sources.list file
          NOTE: debootstrap will NOT install from these. They will be added to the
          top of the sources.list available for future chroot apt package management.

          INSTALL_ISO="/path/to/iso-1.iso,/path/to/iso-2.iso,/path/to/iso-3.iso"

	______________________________________________________________________
          Adding a custom list of packages to be installed along with the defaults will
          require using 2 options together

          EXTRA=1
          FULLINSTALL="vim-tiny,cron,rsyslog,dracut,ntp"
