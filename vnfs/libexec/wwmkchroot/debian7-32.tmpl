#DESC: A base 32 bit Debian wheezy chroot

# The general Deb include has all of the necessary functions, but requires
# some basic variables specific to each chroot type to be defined.

# NOTE: cross architecture support is available when creating 32 bit
# vnfs on 64 bit host. However, the warewulf-provision source will
# need to have been compiled with CFLAGS=-m32 and LDFLAGS=-m32
# in order for the proper bootstrap to be generated from a
# cross arch chroot.
