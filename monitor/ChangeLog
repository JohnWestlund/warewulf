Working on code cleanups and fixes.  This was a first pass at issues
the compiler found and things I noticed while fixing those issues.

Also fixed "make distcheck."

More fixes and cleanups to come....

with parenthesis-aligned continuation indentation).

One down, several to go...

Fix "make clean"

Re-indent globals.h.

Fix typo in data structure member name.  "Accural" is not a word, but
"accrual" is.

The cpu_data structure does not need to be a global definition.

Base size limit for IP address string on actual limit, not random
integer extracted from unspecified source.

Fix sscanf() warnings I accidentally introduced during optimization.
